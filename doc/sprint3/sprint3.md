# :runner: Sprint 3 Planning Meeting :runner:

### Sprint Goal
The main goal of this sprint is to continue expanding the use of Redux in the front-end to have more data being served dynamically from the back-end. New routes will also need to be made in the back-end to serve this data, and new relations will need to be created in the database. To be more specific, main features that we want completed are: a search functionality for other users and projects, a dynamcallly updated profile page that allows us to update our user information, a dynamically updated projects page that allows us to update our project information, the ability to post on a forum, the ability to view trending projects, dynamic paths on the front-end, the ability to see nearby hackathons, and the ability to follow other users and projects.

### Participants 
Matthew Huynh, Furqan Qureshi, Michael Phung, Jarrod Servilla, Rahul Bajaj, Hans Paras, Daniil Oliynyk

### Sprint User Stories
The following are the user stories from our backlog that we would like to complete in Sprint 3:

COL-9 As a User, I would like to be able to follow other Projects and receive notifications so that I can stay up to date with these projects

COL-10 As a User, I want to be able to search for a project by a specific query term so that I can find projects that interest me

COL-11 As a User, I want to be able to view recommended Projects for me (eg. see the most relevant content for me) so that projects can be suggested to me

COL-12 As a User, I would like to be able to configure settings for my Project so that I can customize my project

COL-13 As a User, I want to be able to search for other Users on CollabCloud so that I can learn more about other users on the platform

COL-14 As a User, I want to be able to view all users on the CollabCloud platform and be able to send a request to collaborate on a specific project

COL-15 As a User, I want to be able to view a profile of another User so that I can view their information

COL-16 As a User, I want to be able to post on a message board (or forum) so that I can discuss bugs, recruit others to my project, etc.

COL-17 As a User, I want to be able to follow other users and maintain a list of other users that I am following so that I can keep track of users that are relevant to me

COL-18 As a User, I want to see nearby & relevant hackathons so that I can stay up-to-date with these events

COL-19 As a User, I want to see trending projects on CollabCloud so that I can learn more about trending projects

COL-53 As a User, I want to be able to update my profile page with new information so that I can keep my information up to date

COL-54 As a Developer, I want to be able to use dynamic paths to route to different profiles and projects on the front-end so that navigation is more organized

COL-55 As a User, I should only be able to access protected routes if I am authenticated so that the program is more secure

### Spikes
For this Sprint, the team will not be encountering many new technologies. Many team members are continuing work on the front-end this sprint, so they will be continuing to learn more about advanced React techniques such as React Hooks, and React Redux
- We will need to investigate how to best implement a search feature
- We will need to investigate how to use dynamic paths
- We will need to investigate more about Redux so that we are using it more efficiently

### Team Capacity and Task Breakdown
Our team will be working at full capacity, meaning that everyone is projected to be available to work on the sprint. The team capacity is 70 days, with a 10 planned working days in the sprint and each of the 7 team members spending all ten days working. We will be making sub-tasks for each of the user stories, and recording them in Jira.
