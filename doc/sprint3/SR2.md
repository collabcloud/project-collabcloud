## Participants in the Meeting:
Jarrod, Furqan, Matt, Hans, Rahul, Daniil, Mike

## Unfinished tasks:
- There were no unfinished tasks from Sprint 2!

The following are notes compiled from our Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting

## What are practices that you might want to continue during Sprint 3?
- Everyone started their user story relatively early. This is good, and we want to continue it moving forwards into Sprint 3
- The team followed Git flow, branching properly from dev for each user story, and then merging it back to dev when done
- Integration of all user stories was done earlier, and we were much better prepared for the sprint demo
- People were more punctual
- We managed our project scope very well, considering the deadlines that all team members had with other courses

## What are some new practices that you may want to use during Sprint 3?
- We will continue to prepare for the demo earlier
- We will continue to make better sub-tasks in Jira so that other team members have a better of what we are working on
- Team members should comment out any unnecessary console logs before pushing code
- Team members should do more code documentation
- ALL team members should review pull requests
- ALL team members should test code on a pull request 

## What harmful practices should we stop using during Sprint 3?
- Team members should try to be more dilligent with updating their subtasks and user stories on Jira, as they are being done
- Team members will try to have more conservative time estimates for their tasks

## Best experience during Sprint 3
- Integrating all the features together in the dev branch
- Good learning experience

## Worst experience during Sprint 3
- Trying to balance our responsibilities for CollabCloud with responsibitilies for other courses
