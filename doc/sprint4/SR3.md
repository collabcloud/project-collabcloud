# :speech_balloon: Sprint 3 Retrospective :speech_balloon:

The Sprint 3 Retrospective was conducted on March 12.

## Participants in the Meeting:
Jarrod, Furqan, Matt, Hans, Rahul, Daniil, Mike

## Unfinished tasks:
The following tasks will be carrying over to Sprint 4. Note that each team member took on two user stories this sprint. This was a mistake on our side, as we did not plan scope out as realistically as we should have. Each team member was still able to complete some work for their second user story.

COL-9 As a User, I would like to be able to follow other Projects and receive notifications so that I can stay up to date with these projects

COL-11 As a User, I want to be able to view recommended Projects for me (eg. see the most relevant content for me) so that projects can be suggested to me

COL-14 As a User, I want to be able to view all users on the CollabCloud platform and be able to send a request to collaborate on a specific project

COL-15 As a User, I want to be able to view a profile of another User so that I can view their information

COL-18 As a User, I want to see nearby & relevant hackathons so that I can stay up-to-date with these events

COL-19 As a User, I want to see trending projects on CollabCloud so that I can learn more about trending projects

COL-54 As a Developer, I want to be able to use dynamic paths to route to different profiles and projects on the front-end so that navigation is more organized

The following are notes compiled from our Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

## What are practices that you might want to continue during Sprint 4?
- Team members are communicating more, which is good
- Team members are also collaborating more, helping each other with tasks
- Git flow was followed well by all members of the team. This is good and we should keep it up.
- Meetings were more efficient, with the entire team staying on task and discussing important topics

## What are some new practices that you may want to use during Sprint 4?
- We still need to be using Jira more effectively by tracking our user stories and breaking them up into sub-tasks
- Code maintenance and refactoring will play a bigger role in Sprint 4
- Team members should comment out any unnecessary console logs before pushing code
- Team members should do more code documentation
- ALL team members should review pull requests
- ALL team members should test code on a pull request 

## What harmful practices should we stop using during Sprint 4?
- This sprint, each team member took on two user stories. We realize that this type of workload was not realistic, as each team member had other responsibilities for other courses, etc. to fulfill. For the next sprint, we will be more realistic with our work load
- We will try to start our user stories earlier in sprint 4

## Best experience during Sprint 4
- Integrating all the features together in the dev branch
- Good learning experience
- Demoing to the team and demoing to the TA

## Worst experience during Sprint 4
- Trying to balance our responsibilities for CollabCloud with responsibitilies for other courses
