# :runner: Sprint 4 Planning Meeting :runner:

### Sprint Goal
The main goal of this sprint is to get our product to a MVP state. We want to ensure that all features on the front-end are able to hit the back-end. We will focus on finishing up user stories that we carried over from Sprint 3, and then focus on refactoring and refining our codebase so that our features are more robust.

### Participants 
Matthew Huynh, Furqan Qureshi, Michael Phung, Jarrod Servilla, Rahul Bajaj, Hans Paras, Daniil Oliynyk

### Sprint User Stories
The following are the user stories from our backlog that we would like to complete in Sprint 3:

COL-9 As a User, I would like to be able to follow other Projects and receive notifications so that I can stay up to date with these projects

COL-11 As a User, I want to be able to view recommended Projects for me (eg. see the most relevant content for me) so that projects can be suggested to me

COL-14 As a User, I want to be able to view all users on the CollabCloud platform and be able to send a request to collaborate on a specific project

COL-15 As a User, I want to be able to view a profile of another User so that I can view their information

COL-18 As a User, I want to see nearby & relevant hackathons so that I can stay up-to-date with these events

COL-19 As a User, I want to see trending projects on CollabCloud so that I can learn more about trending projects

COL-20 As a User, I want to be able to send and receive messages to other users so that I can communicate with them

COL-54 As a Developer, I want to be able to use dynamic paths to route to different profiles and projects on the front-end so that navigation is more organized

COL-93 As a User, I want to be able to upload a picture to display my avatar and pictures for my project.

COL-94 As a Developer, I want to make improvements to the Projects feature so that the feature is more robust

### Spikes
For this Sprint, the team will not be encountering many new technologies. Many team members are continuing work on the front-end this sprint, so they will be continuing to learn more about advanced React techniques such as React Hooks, and React Redux.

There are some specific topics that we haven't encountered before, so these will need some research:
- We will need to figure out how to get data about other hackathons
- We will need to figure out how we decide what makes a project 'trending'
- We will need to figure out how to best implement messaging


### Team Capacity and Task Breakdown
Our team will be working at full capacity, meaning that everyone is projected to be available to work on the sprint. The team capacity is 70 days, with a 10 planned working days in the sprint and each of the 7 team members spending all ten days working. We will be making sub-tasks for each of the user stories, and recording them in Jira.
