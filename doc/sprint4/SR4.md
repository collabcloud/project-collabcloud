## Unfinished tasks:
- COL-14

The following are notes compiled from our Sprint 4 Retrospective Meeting

## What are practices that you might want to continue in the future?
- The team followed Git flow, branching properly from dev for each user story, and then merging it back to dev when done
- We managed our project scope very well, considering the deadlines that all team members had with other courses

## What are some new practices that you may want to start doing?
- We will continue to prepare for the demo earlier
- We will continue to make better sub-tasks in Jira so that other team members have a better of what we are working on
- Team members should comment out any unnecessary console logs before pushing code
- Team members should do more code documentation
- ALL team members should review pull requests
- ALL team members should test code on a pull request 

## What harmful practices should we stop doing?
- Team members should stay up to date with the group chat and not miss anything important
- Team members should try to follow deadlines, such as for standups
- Team members should keep their promises
- Team members should try to be more dilligent with updating their subtasks and user stories on Jira, as they are being done

## Best experience during Sprint 4
- Integrating all the features together in the dev branch
- Demo went very well!
- Good learning experience

## Worst experience during Sprint 4
- Having to redo my components after changes were made from other user stories (Jarrod)
- Having unfinished user stories
