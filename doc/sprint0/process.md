# Process
Our team worked well together. All team members are communicating through the primary agreed-upon mode of communication, which is through WhatsApp Messenger. We also held a total of three in-person meetings so far. We have followed all of our guidelines set out in team.md so far.

## :speech_balloon: Decision Making :speech_balloon:
Major decisions are made as a team during our team meetings. As mentioned in team.md, weekly in-person meetings are held on Thursdays from 12-1PM in the DH Study Rooms. Major decisions include those such as architectural design decisions, decisions of what technologies and programming languages to use, and user stories. Smaller decisions such as implementation specific details (eg. how tables will be structured in our relational database) will be handled by those who are working on the database. Smaller decisions may also be discussed in our WhatsApp messenger group chat.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Prioritizing User Stories :chart_with_downwards_trend: ##
We defined priority and points of user stories by using the Week 3 lecture slides as a guide. We have included information about this in PB.md, but we will reiterate here:

The priority of each user story ranges from: Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest. User stories that are prioritized higher are features that we think are most important to be included in our release. These features are also those that are considered to be “base features”, and capture the most essential use cases of our application.

The numerical series that our team will use to estimate user stories is the modified sequence of Fibonacci numbers that was shown in class: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. It took about two rounds of voting to reach a consensus for the point estimate for each user story. The first round typically had widely varying point ranges, while the second round had more uniform point ranges. A third round was rarely needed.

## :calendar: Meetings :calendar: ##
As mentioned in our team.md document, weekly in-person meetings are held on Thursdays from 12-1PM in the DH Study Rooms. We have met in-person three times so far. We have also followed the guidelines in team.md, having prepared meeting agendas before each meeting and then meeting minutes after the meeting that summarized each meeting. All members have attended all meetings so far. We have not held any online meetings yet, but as the project progresses, we may hold online meetings if it is necessary to plan out any features.

## :sparkles: Next Phase :sparkles: ##
In the next phase, we will be sure to keep following the processes that we have created and followed so far. As a team, we are satisfied with the progress so far, and we believe that we have a structured and well thought-out plan that will ease the development process. 

When we start development, we are planning on working in smaller teams of 2 to 3 when implementing user stories. We believe that this is a good strategy, because having multiple team members work on a feature will mean that these members will have a good understanding of the feature. These team members can then share what they have learned during any team meetings and during code reviews. Having smaller teams of 2-3 also means that other members of the team will be able to focus on other user stories. 

One thing that could be improved is the communication of any office hours. For example, if some group members visit Professor Dema during office hours for any project-related questions, then those group members will post any updates for the rest of the group.
