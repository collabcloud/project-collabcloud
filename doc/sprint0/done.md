## :ballot_box_with_check: Acceptance Criteria :ballot_box_with_check:
All of our User Stories will have an Acceptance Criteria. A User Story cannot be marked as "Complete" in Jira until it meets all of its Acceptance Criteria. 

In general, we follow some guidelines when creating our Acceptance Criteria. Our Acceptance Criteria must:
- Help our team understand what each User Story is ultimately trying to achieve
- Be testable -- other team members must be able to verify that Acceptance Criteria has been achieved by looking at the product of that User Story

The acceptance criteria will vary for different user stories, however, most user stories will have some common themes in their acceptance criteria:
- The added feature should add value in some way to whichever stakeholder (eg. end user, other developer, etc) that the User Story was meant for
- All added features should be tested, either through manual tests or through test cases such as unit tests, etc.
- All features should be reviewed and approved in a code review by at least a few other team members
- All features should be well-documented, either through internal documentation (in-line comments) or external documentation (README.md or other similar files)


## :clipboard: Who gets to decide the specific Acceptance Criteria for a User Story? :clipboard:
The Acceptance Criteria for each User Story will be decided when the User Story is added to the product backlog. Other members of the team may provide input when creating the Acceptance Criteria. Acceptance Criteria for a task in the product backlog is not final, and is subject to change, and may be modified during a team meeting (eg. Sprint planning meeting) in a flexible and Agile manner if the team deems it most effective to do so.
