# Summary

## :bookmark: Project Objective :bookmark:

Build a social networking platform built on top of Github’s API allowing users to post projects seeking collaborators, join projects, and find projects that would be best suited for their skillset and needs. This project will cater towards students and have extensive social networking features.

## :boy: Key Users :girl:

Grace Hopper is a 4th year computer science student in university, who has **experience in the workplace** as a software developer and **has more project ideas than time**. She has tried in the past to work on side projects with fellow students and friends, however she has found that their interests/skills did not align with her own, resulting in an unfortunate amount of abandoned projects.

Remy Tentacion is a 2nd year computer science student in college, who is **seeking opportunities outside of school** to make himself more marketable in hopes of **obtaining an internship**. Outside of the programming languages he has learnt in school, he has a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and Javascript but does not know where to start to create a side project, so he is **looking for either hackathons** or **projects to join** with the leadership of others that are more experienced than him.

## :key: Key Scenarios :key:

Grace notices that her school’s class scheduling system can be inadequate at times, and thus wants to create her own project called optimize.me that provides students with the optimal schedule based on parameters such as their program, courses taken, and requirements to graduate. She wants to find a suitable place to put up her project idea  and maximize her chances to **find teammates that will be able to work well together** and accomplish the task at hand.

Remy wants to find some **nearby hackathons** that he can attend as a beginner. It is important to him that the **hackathon offers workshops** on an introductory level, be **open to all skill levels**, and **find a group that is like-minded**.

Remy is hoping to find a project that he can contribute to, but doesn’t know where to start. He hopes to find projects on CollabCloud that he’ll be **able to understand and jump into**, **contribute with the skills that he currently has**, and whose **contributors live nearby or are in the same situation** as he is so that he can get along well with them.

## :loudspeaker: Key Principles :loudspeaker:

**Intuitive User Experience** - The website should be easy to navigate and understand for new users, therefore maximizing the likelihood that they will continue to use CollabCloud as a product.

**Provide Initiative to Student Programmers** - Provide student programmers with the resources and know-how to be able to confidently expand their skillset outside of school, by attending hackathons and contributing to projects, in hopes to make them more marketable for finding jobs in the workplace.

**Provide Convenience to Users** - Users should be shown the most relevant information, such as hackathons in their area or projects that would be most appealing to them in order to reduce the time spent searching for the content that they are looking for.
