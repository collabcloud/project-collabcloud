## :chart_with_downwards_trend: Division of Work :chart_with_downwards_trend:
At the beginning of each week, the team will look at the product backlog, members will add user stories to the sprint backlog that they wish to take on, and changes will be made by the leads as needed (such as if work is too much, members may not be suited to take on the task, etc).

## :office: Weekly Meetings :office:
Location: DH Study Rooms
Thursday, 12-1PM (until 2PM if needed)

Depending on the timing of the meeting, it will have a specific purpose.

If it occurs at the start of the sprint, then the meeting will serve as a retrospective on what we did for the previous sprint and how we can improve. Next, we will choose user stories from the product backlog, bring them into the sprint backlog, and take user stories as needed.  

If it occurs in the middle of the sprint, then the meeting will serve as a mid-sprint review to keep track of progress on user stories, identifying blockers, receive feedback on work,

**Required Preparation:** A meeting agenda will be prepared the night before. All team members should review the meeting agenda before the meeting. When the meeting starts, brief meeting minute notes will be made by a team member to summarize what happened in the meeting

## :bar_chart: Version Control :bar_chart:

**What to commit:** Completed user stories with verified testing

**What not to commit:** Incomplete user stories that may introduce bugs.

**Content of commit messages:** Starts with an emoji according to our git emoji commit guidelines, then a concise summary of the changes that were made. First character should be capitalized.

We will be following a modified version of Git flow that is well-adapted for our team. Once Sprint 1 starts, we should only commit release code (eg. code that can presented during our sprint demos) to the master branch.

|Commit Type  |Emoji  |
|--|--|
|Initial Commit  | :tada: |
|New Feature  | :sparkles: |
|Refactor Code  |:hammer:  |
|Work in progress  | :construction: |
|Removing code/files  | :fire: |
|Documentation  | :books: |
|Reverting changes  | :rewind: |
| Bug |  :bug: |
|Critical hotfix  | :ambulance: |
|Code review changes  | :ok_hand: |
|Final Commit before Merging  | :heavy_check_mark: |
|Merging Branches  | :twisted_rightwards_arrows: |
|Install Packages  | :package: |

Any other commit types not covered in this table can be referenced from [here](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a).

Three types of branches will be maintained:

- **Master** - This will only contain working, presentable code that will be committed after the sprint has concluded.

- **Dev** - This is a branch used to integrate feature branches for a sprint, and perform testing. Developers that want to work on a user story should make a new “User story branch” that branches off of Dev.

- **User story branches** - These branches are made by developers for each user story to implement the user story and can be worked on by multiple developers if needed.


**Nomenclature:** Name will be US + (F/B/DB/FS) + user story number + -[name of user story].

Eg. “USF01-ReactLogin”
- F = front-end
- B = back-end
- DB = database
- FS = fullstack

For example, for a login button component, it could be: USF01-LoginButton

## :mailbox: Deliverable Submission :mailbox:

**When to submit:** Before or on the sprint deadline

**Who will submit:** User story owner

**Who will review:** Any of the other members can review, with final approval being given by one of the leads (Furqan, Jarrod, Matt).

## :heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark: Contingency Plans :heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark:

**In the event of a team member dropping the course:** Work will be distributed evenly amongst remaining members

**If a team member misses a meeting:** A meeting summary will be put up and they can ask any members that did attend to summarize what was discussed.

**If a team member does not complete their tasks on time:** Task will roll over to the next sprint and if deemed necessary, they will take on less work for the next sprint.

**If a team member is academically dishonest:** If we suspect that a team member is academically dishonest, we will hold an emergency meeting with all group members. During this meeting, we will gather all the information we know about any academically dishonest behaviours. We will then forward this information to the professors and TAs to discuss the next steps.
