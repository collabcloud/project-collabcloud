## :blue_book: How Our Product is Different :blue_book:

Our product acts more like a social network than the other competitors. We will have direct messaging in the app unlike up-for-grabs or codetriage. Another distinguishing feature is that we will allow users to create a profile on our app to showcase their skills and past/current contributions which will allow our app to better recommend possible projects. Our geolocation feature will also allow users to find nearby projects and connect with nearby developers to build connections. With this feature we will also be able to show nearby hackathons and events.

## :boy: :key: Key Users and Scenarios :boy: :key:
We will mainly focus on helping students help find projects to contribute to. This way university students can make meaningful contributions to other people’s projects, if they cannot come up with an idea for their own project, and have something to put on their resume. This will also allow other students to finish their projects and put them on their resume too.
## :mag_right: Competitors Focus :mag_right:
The competitors mainly focused on all types of people to find to contribute to open source projects. We wish to specifically target students. For them to switch their main target audience to students would require for them to change their recommendation system to target profiles which are linked to university students.
