# :runner: Sprint 2 Planning Meeting :runner:

### Sprint Goal
The main goal of this sprint is to proliferate the use of Redux in the front-end to have more data being served dynamically from the back-end. We want to be able to view Projects that we have added, and we want to also further refine features added last sprint. By the end of this sprint, we would like: a dashboard, a User Profile page, an Explore Projects page, the ability to view your own Git Repo, more robust design and code for registration and login page, and an improved Create Projects page.

### Participants 
Matthew Huynh, Furqan Qureshi, Michael Phung, Jarrod Servilla, Rahul Bajaj, Hans Paras, Daniil Oliynyk

### Sprint User Stories
The following are the user stories from our backlog that we would like to complete in Sprint 2
COL-4 As a User, I want to be greeted with a home page (dashboard) after I successfully authenticate so that I can view any updates
COL-6 As a User, I want to be able to create my own public profile so I can keep track of my own information
COL-7 As a User, I want to be able to load, store, and display my existing repositories from GitHub so that I can view information related to my repository
COL-8 As a User, I would like to be able to view all public projects on CollabCloud so that I can learn more about other projects on Explore
COL-34 As a Developer, I want to improve the Register page so that the registration flow is more robust
COL-35 As a Developer, I want to improve the Login page so that it authorizes the user and routes to the homepage
COL-36 As a User, I want to be able to add more information about my Project so that I can view more info about my project

We have a special user story (categorized as a task) that is meant to help us organize our integration and preparation for the demo
COL-37 As a Developer, I want to ensure that all features integrated in preparation for the demo so that we are prepared

### Spikes
For this Sprint, the team will not be encountering many new technologies. One technology that will require some learning is querying the GitHub API. Many team members are beginning work on the front-end this sprint, so they will be learning advanced React techniques such as React Routing, React Hooks, and React Redux. 

### Team Capacity and Task Breakdown
Our team will be working at full capacity, meaning that everyone is projected to be available to work on the sprint. We will likely be making sub-tasks for each of the user stories.
